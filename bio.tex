Gabrielle Cantor is a sophomore at Indiana University from Denver, Colorado. She is majoring in Intelligent Systems Engineering with a concentration in Cyber-Physical Systems, and minors in Math and Urban Planning & Community Development. Her professional interests lie in  the fields of robotics, wearable technology, and the development of smart devices (smart homes, smart cars, and smart cities). This past summer she had the opportunity to participate in the IU ProHealth REU, and is continuing her research this year through the Center of Excellence for Women in Technology Emerging Scholars REU. Her research studies how to design technological interventions for patients with Discordant Chronic Comorbidities, which is the simultaneous presence of two or more chronic conditions with differing treatment instructions. After studying the different barriers patients faced in being able to successfully manage their conditions and treatments, she is now working on designing and creating a mobile application that will help them to manage their overall health and wellbeing.
